Analyze Wealth Distributions Among Developed Nations
---------------

The OECD collects and publishes various [stats](stats.oecd.org) across developed (and certain developing countries).
The data can be accessed through an API, but the json structure isn't particularly friendly to visualization.

I intend to make a simple python module that converts the returned json data into a(n overly verbose) DataFrame
(or a .csv, if you'd like).

Since the purpose of getting this data is for visualization, here's a

to the Tableau Worksheet (work in progress).
